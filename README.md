# PowerME: a Power Model Explorer
The Power Model Explorer (PowerME) is a graphical tool to ease multiple scenario modelling of energy based systems.
It is coded in the Java Programming Language, using AWT/Swing components.

It initially works with [GridLAB-D models](https://www.gridlabd.org/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/gridlab-d/gridlab-d)), however, the intention is to port it to [OpenDSS](https://smartgrid.epri.com/SimulationTool.aspx) and [pandapower](http://www.pandapower.org/) as well.

Project Start: October/2020
