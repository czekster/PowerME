# PowerME: a Power Model Explorer
The Power Model Explorer (PowerME) is a graphical tool to ease multiple scenario modelling of energy based systems.
It is coded in the Java Programming Language, using AWT/Swing components.

It works with [GridLAB-D models](https://www.gridlabd.org/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/gridlab-d/gridlab-d)) converted to XML counterpart.

To use the tool, you must first run gridlabd (GNU/Linux) appending the following line to your .glm model:

  `#set savefile="model.xml"`
